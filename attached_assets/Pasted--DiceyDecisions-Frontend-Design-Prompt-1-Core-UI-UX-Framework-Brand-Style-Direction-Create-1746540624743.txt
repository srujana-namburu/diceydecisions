# DiceyDecisions - Frontend Design Prompt 1: Core UI/UX Framework

## Brand & Style Direction
Create a playful, game-show inspired interface with:
- Vibrant color palette dominated by purples, blues, and energetic accent colors
- Rounded corners, playful typography, and dice/game motifs throughout
- Fun micro-animations for state changes, but keep them brief and non-distracting
- Mobile-first responsive design that works well on all screen sizes

## Authentication Screens
### Login Screen
- Clean, centered form with email and password fields
- "Sign up" option prominently displayed for new users
- Subtle dice animation in background that doesn't interfere with readability
- Form validation with helpful error messages
- "Forgot password" option below login button

### Sign Up Screen
- Email, password, confirm password, and display name fields
- Password strength indicator
- Terms of service checkbox
- Clear success/error states
- Animated transition to the dashboard upon successful signup

## Dashboard / Home
- Welcoming header with user's name
- Large, prominent "Create New Decision" button/card
- "Join a Decision" section with code entry field
- Recent decisions section showing rooms user has participated in
- Clean navigation for accessing profile settings

## Decision Room Creation Flow
### Create Room Form
- Room title field (required)
- Optional description field with character counter
- Optional max participants selector
- Toggle for "Allow participants to add options" (default: on)
- Create button with subtle dice animation on hover

### Room Created Success Screen
- Large, copyable room code displayed prominently
- One-click copy button for the code
- Shareable link with copy button
- QR code option for easy sharing
- Clear "Enter Room" button to proceed
- Option to directly invite friends via email (optional for MVP)

## Past Decisions View
- Card-based list view of past decisions
- Each card shows:
  * Room title
  * Date/time resolved
  * Winning option highlighted
  * Indicator of tiebreaker used (if any)
- Sorting options (newest first, alphabetical)
- Empty state with friendly message for new users

## Responsive Design Requirements
- Fully functional on mobile devices (320px width minimum)
- Tablet-optimized views
- Desktop version with efficient use of additional screen space
- Touch-friendly UI elements throughout

## Accessibility Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Clear focus states for keyboard navigation
- Screen reader friendly elements
- Sufficient color contrast
- Alternative text for all icons and visual elements

## Technical Considerations
- Design components that can easily integrate with frontend frameworks
- Consider state management needs (loading, error, success states for all interactions)
- Ensure animations are performant and can be disabled for users who prefer reduced motion
