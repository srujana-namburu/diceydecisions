# DiceyDecisions - Frontend Design Prompt 3: Interactive Elements & System Architecture

## Game Mechanics Visualizations
### Dice Roll Implementation
- 3D rendered dice or high-quality 2D animation sequence
- Multiple frames showing tumbling/rolling motion
- Sound effects (optional but recommended)
- Final result clearly displayed with number highlighted
- Animation duration: 2-3 seconds (not too long to maintain engagement)
- Ensure randomness is visually convincing

### Spinner Mechanism
- Colorful wheel divided into equal sections for each tied option
- Text labels clearly visible on each section
- Arrow/pointer indicator that remains static while wheel spins
- Variable speed animation (fast start, gradually slowing)
- Slight wobble at end for dramatic effect
- Winner section highlighted with visual emphasis

### Coin Flip Animation
- Realistic 3D coin or stylized 2D animation
- Clear heads/tails sides with distinct visuals
- Flipping animation with proper physics
- Landing animation with slight wobble
- Result callout after landing
- Ensure randomness appears fair and unbiased

## State Management Requirements
- User authentication state
- Current room data:
  * Room status (open/closed)
  * Participant list
  * Options list with votes (hidden until reveal)
  * User's role (creator/participant)
  * User's voting status
- Visual indicators for all state changes
- Loading states for async operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Success confirmations for key actions

## Component Architecture Suggestions
- Reusable UI components:
  * Button variants (primary, secondary, danger)
  * Form inputs with validation
  * Cards for options display
  * Modal dialogs for confirmations
  * Toast notifications
  * Game mechanics animations
- Page/View components:
  * Authentication pages
  * Dashboard/Home
  * Create Room
  * Active Room
  * Results View
  * Past Decisions
- Layout components:
  * Navigation
  * Page containers
  * Responsive wrappers

## Integration Points
- Authentication service hooks
- API endpoints for room operations
- Local storage for recent rooms
- Webhook or polling system for updates
- Animation triggers based on state changes
- Tiebreaker mechanism that receives random values from backend

## System Behavior Requirements
- Handle network interruptions gracefully
- Persist state between page refreshes where appropriate
- Clear feedback for all user actions
- Timeouts for inactive rooms (30 min)
- Automatic polling every 3-5 seconds for updates
- Prevent duplicate votes or submissions
- Creator-only controls properly secured in UI
- Prevent access to results before voting

## Motion Design Guidelines
- Keep animations under 500ms for UI elements
- Game animations (dice, spinner, coin) should be 2-3 seconds
- Easing functions:
  * UI elements: ease-in-out
  * Game animations: custom physics-based easing
- Reduced motion alternatives for accessibility
- Consistent animation language throughout
- Animations should enhance not hinder the experience

## Dark Mode / Theme Support
- Light and dark theme variants
- Consistent color palette across themes
- High contrast options for accessibility
- Theme toggle in user settings

## Implementation Notes
- Prioritize mobile performance
- Consider progressive enhancement
- Keep animations performant (prefer CSS/SVG animations where possible)
- Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate hover/focus/active states
- Test with various screen readers and assistive technologies
